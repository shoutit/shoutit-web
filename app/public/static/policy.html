<body class="c8"><p class="c6 title"><a name="h.j52j417b75o4"></a><span>ShoutIt Privacy Policy</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Shoutit application and the associated Shoutit website available at www.Shoutit.com (&ldquo;Shoutit&ldquo;) are owned and operated by Syrex, FZ-LLC. (&ldquo;us&ldquo; &ldquo;we&ldquo;
    or &ldquo;our&ldquo;). The Shoutit application and website provide a platform where you can connect with people in your vicinity who are seeking or providing useful products or services. In addition, Shoutit enables you to keep track of what you like, tell others about what you like, discover new things to try, and find out what your friends enjoy, all in one place (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). This Shoutit Privacy Policy (the &ldquo;Privacy Policy&ldquo;) is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information submitted to us or collected through your use of Shoutit. The information addressed in this Privacy Policy includes &ldquo;Personal Information,&ldquo;
    which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your full name, physical address or e-mail address, as well as &ldquo;Non-Identifiable Information,&ldquo;
    which is non-public information that may be associated with or linked to a specific Shoutit account but does not by itself permit the identification of individual persons (e.g., demographic, interest, or site usage information). This Privacy Policy does not pertain to any information that is publicly available on or through Shoutit.</span>
</p>

<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.bp16m84j1s5r"></a><span class="c3">User Consent</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">By accessing or otherwise using Shoutit, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and the associated Terms of Service (set forth on http://www.Shoutit.com/tos). You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</span>
</p>

<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.g9mhj38bxskn"></a><span class="c3">Regarding Children</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Shoutit and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user&#39;s Personal Information from our databases. By using Shoutit, you are representing that you are able to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction.</span>
</p>

<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.hoenhu5jgky3"></a><span class="c3">Collection and Use of Information</span></h2>

<h3 class="c5"><a name="h.63yb57q6fkrk"></a><span class="c2">Information Submitted to Shoutit</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">In general, we collect both Personal Information and Non-Identifiable Information that you submit to us voluntarily through Shoutit. We collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on Shoutit. For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, a valid email address and a password of your choice. When using our Application through a mobile device, we will also collect your mobile phone number as part of your registration information. When you personalize your profile and use the features of Shoutit, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of Shoutit, including such Non-Identifiable Information as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information. We also collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of Shoutit, such as photos, reviews, ratings and other information you choose to submit, including information from other social networks that you choose to link to your Shoutit profile.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our &ldquo;Feedback&ldquo; form through Shoutit, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide. When you finalize transactions with other Shoutit users, you will need to submit your credit card or other payment information so that our service providers can process your payment for those products and services. When you participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other activities that we make available on Shoutit, we will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include your Personal Information to permit us to contact you in connection with that activity. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and all related information. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments, or forums within the Shoutit community.</span>
</p>

<h3 class="c5"><a name="h.mghk1k798rzn"></a><span class="c2">Information from Other Sources</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">We may receive information, including Personal Information, about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies with whom we have partnered (collectively, &ldquo;Partners&ldquo;) or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you. If you connect to Shoutit through another social network, we may collect information about you and your friends from that social network in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. For instance, we may collect your user ID or profile information from that third-party social network that you have permitted to be displayed through Shoutit in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and connections. Shoutit will treat this information in the same manner as we treat the information we collect directly from you. However, please remember that the third party providers of such information handle it according to their own privacy policies.</span>
</p>

<h3 class="c5"><a name="h.kz5ue6i9gu0l"></a><span class="c2">Information Collected Via Technology</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">As you use Shoutit, certain technical and usage information may be collected from you, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. In connection with your use of the Shoutit Application through a mobile device, we may also gather information from your mobile device including its unique identification number and your geographic location. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on Shoutit you clicked. This type of information is collected to make Shoutit and its solutions more useful to you and to tailor the Shoutit experience to meet your special interests and needs.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">An &ldquo;Internet protocol address&ldquo; or &ldquo;IP Address&ldquo; is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access Shoutit to assist with ad targeting.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Cookies&ldquo; are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer&rsquo;s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with Shoutit. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. In order to use our services offered through Shoutit, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of Shoutit may not work properly, and you will not be able to receive our services.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">We may also enable third-party advertising networks, advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on Shoutit. These advertisers and ad servers may use their own Cookies and/or &ldquo;Web Beacons&ldquo;
    (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to those advertisements and your use of Shoutit. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers. For more information about third-party advertising, and to exercise your choices regarding advertising customization by third-party ad networks, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website.

<h3 class="c5"><a name="h.yz0qitw1kfbn"></a><span class="c2">Aggregate Information</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">Additionally, we may use your Non-Identifiable Information in connection with compiling Aggregate Information about general site usage in order to perform statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of Shoutit. Such Aggregate Information will not include your Personal Information.</span>
</p>

<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.dn21l2ncypxy"></a><span class="c3">Use and Disclosure of Information</span></h2>

</p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message or notifications from a social network or other website with whom you have registered to receive such notifications).

</p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">Mergers or Acquisitions/Change of Control: Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control, we may in the future, and we may share some or all of your Personal Information with these companies, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c4">In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours, or their agents, may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</span>

You hereby consent to our sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein.</span>
