<h1>Marketplace Rules</h1>

<p>Shoutit is a platform for connecting buyers and sellers. Whether you&#39;re looking to find a graphic designer, get coffee delivered to your office, sell used furniture, buy a new iPad or help find a band for your daughter&rsquo;s wedding, we want everyone to have a safe and enjoyable experience, so it&#39;s important to act in a respectful and responsible manner.
</p>

<p>Please take a moment to review these Marketplace Rules.</p>

<h2>Trust and Safety</h2>

<p>Participating in the Shoutit marketplace involves real people and real stuff. It&#39;s essential to protect yourself and use common sense, just like any other time you do business with someone new.
</p>

<h3>Safety First</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Always meet in a public place, like a caf&eacute; or bank. Avoid doing large transactions in cash.
    </li>
    <li>Take care to protect your personal information, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card number. Only provide your personal information to the secure Shoutit application.
    </li>
    <li>The Shoutit application allows you to communicate directly with buyers and sellers, so there should never be a need to share your personal information with others.
    </li>
</ul>
